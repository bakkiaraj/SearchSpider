# SearchSpider
Search Spider is created using perl with GTK+ as a front end.
It is basically a Web Spider, Which can find links from given seed site also search in the found web pages.
In simple terms, It works like a web search engine without indexing any data.
Search Spider is also a good example for Perl GTK2 usage and Using GTK2 widgets inside perl threads.
